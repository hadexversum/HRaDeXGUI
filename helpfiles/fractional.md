# Use fractional values

Indicator if the values from different time points are to be scaled with maximal deuteration control.

If selected, the values will be presented in percentages [%], scaled using the undeuterated and maximal deuteration controls.

If not, the values will be presented in daltons [Da] - as mass uptake. From the mass measurement the undeuterated control will be substracted to get the mass uptake.
