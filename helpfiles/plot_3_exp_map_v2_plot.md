# Map of strongest classes

## What is this showing?

This plot shows the assigned $k$ values for two biggest $n_i$ groups. Obviously, this is only shown for the uptake curves fitted with 2 exp or 3 exp functions.

## How to interpret this results?

See if the $k$ values are possibly different and alingned in a form of a cloud. If there is a tendency that the $k$ values are lined on the lower/upper boundary of the class, this may suggest that the class boundaries should be changed.

## Additionaly

This plot serves as quality control for the fitting process. If there is anything suspicious, try different fitting parameters and check if the situation improves.
