# Classification coverage

## What is this showing?

Coverage plot presents the classification code for each peptide in the form of coverage plot - to see their position on the protein structure and how they overlap each other.
The class of each peptides is assigned based on the fitting proces. The fitted curve can be seen in the `Plots` tab.

## How to interpret this results?

Here you can verify the classification process for overlapping peptides. If the overlapping peptides are classified similarly in the region, there is strong ground to aggregate the results to the high-resolution level.
