## Is it FD?

Indicator if the measurement done in time point selected as `Deut 100%` is to be treated as Fully Deuterated control.

If so and the `fractional` indicator is checked, all of the measurements will be scaled to FD, and this point of measurement will not be presented on the uptake curve.

If not and the `fractional` indicator is checked, all of the measurements will be scaled to the results from time point `Deut 100%` but this point will be presented on the uptake curve with 100% of deuteration and will be used in the fitting process.
