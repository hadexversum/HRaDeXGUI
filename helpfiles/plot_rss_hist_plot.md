# RSS plot 

## What is this showing?

This plot shows RSS values for the fitted function for each of the peptide.
The values are shown separately, as RSS value is not affected by the number of parameters, and this vary between options of fitted functions.

## How to interpret this results?
All of the RSS values should be low, possibly close to 0 to ensure that the fitting process is conducted precisely. 

## Additionaly
Based on the chosen workflow, several versions of function to be fitted are used, and the best one (based on BIC value) is selected.

This plot serves as quality control for the fitting process. If there is anything suspicious, try different fitting parameters and check if the situation improves.
