# Hires components

## What is this showing?

The results from the top plot - high-resoultion values for each residue = are presented in different, convoluted form. All of the components of color code are shown separately.

Starting from the bottom: red (fast) component, green (medium) and blue (component). The intensity of each color is adequate with $n_i$ value. The white spots are consisted with given $n_i$ equal to 0. The grey regions are not covered by the experimental data.

If the fitted function is a two-component function, one of the bar is white ($n_i = 0$). If it is one-component function, two bars are white. If the peptide was classified as no exchange case, black color is in all three bars to distinquish this from cases with one or two white elements.


## How to interpret this results?

The tendency of exchange can be spotted, regions that have strong medium exchange component etc. 

## Additionaly

This plot is readable for people with color-blindeness.
